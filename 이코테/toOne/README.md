# To One

<h3>
    The two choose available. </br>
    1. Abstract 1 from N </br>
    2. Divise N to K </br>
</h3>

I used greedy algorithm. Simply, run second choice repeatly if no rest. And if rest exist, choose number 1. </br>

But in special case, too many time spends. So by using mathematical formula, I could improve speed of code. </br>
