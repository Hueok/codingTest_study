    In implementing move of character on coordinate system, usually two methods are used. </br>
    1. Define two variable "dx" and "dy". And by using it, make vector. </br>
    2. Define one variable "steps". Unlike method 1, the type of this variable is list and type of second dimension value is tuple. Like method 1, make vector by using it.
