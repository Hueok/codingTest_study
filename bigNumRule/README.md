# codingTest_study_bigNumRule

instead of using loop syntax, Using sequence and mathematical thinking, speed improves.

In other words, in file of bigNumRule1.py, I calculated 'result' in looping context while considering 'k'. but, in file of bigNumRule2.py, instead of loop, I used sequence. The count of biggest number is just M//(K+1) if no rest. and if rest exist, count includes M%(K+1). For example, given largest num and second largest num [6,5] and K = 3, then sequence {6,6,5} is repeated.
Thie idea improves code speed vastly.
